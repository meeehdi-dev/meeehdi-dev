# yo! ðŸ‘‹

i'm a software engineer that mainly works on full-stack typescript and react projects.

as for my hobbies I try to play with other stuff, such as lua neovim plugins, golang or vue.

### [bropilot.nvim](https://github.com/meeehdi-dev/bropilot.nvim)
copilot.vim replacement that uses ollama for local-only code suggestions.
also recently added codestral and copilot-lsp (with next edit suggestion).

### [dbisous](https://github.com/meeehdi-dev/dbisous)
alternative to dbeaver using wails (golang equivalent to electron) and vue.
